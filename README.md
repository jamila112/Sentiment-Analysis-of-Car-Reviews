# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Car-Reviews

The automotive industry is constantly evolving, with an increasing demand for
vehicles and changing user expectations. User reviews about automobiles, which are
easily accessible on various websites, have become a valuable source of information.
Analyzing and ranking the sentiments expressed in these reviews can provide
essential information to car manufacturers, dealers and potential buyers. This project
aims to develop a sentiment analysis system capable of efficiently analyzing and
classifying user reviews of automobiles.
The project uses natural language processing techniques to preprocess and
clean the textual data from user reviews. These techniques include tokenization,
lemmatization and the removal of empty words in order to classify the feelings
expressed in the reviews as positive, negative or neutral.
The objective of this work is to propose a semi-supervised learning system using
self-training and co-training methods to improve the analysis of feelings and the
ranking of user reviews.
The project focuses on four popular machine learning algorithms, namely
support vector machines (SVM), XGboost, Naive Bayes and logistic regression. These
algorithms are used to train sentiment classifiers using a small labeled dataset of user
reviews in the automotive industry. Then, the unlabeled data is used to extend the
training set through self-training and co-training. After conducting in-depth
experiments and analyzing the results, we will be able to compare the results of self-
training and co-training in order to choose the best classifier for sentiment analysis.
Key words: Sentiment analysis, Sentiment classification, Natural language
processing, Semi-supervised learning, Self-training, Co-training, Machine learning.
